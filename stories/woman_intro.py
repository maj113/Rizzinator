miaIntr = "\n Hi I'm Mia and I'm 18 and a half. I've always been the tall girl and I was sometimes even bullied for it. I kind of get it I mean I'm 6ft4\" (195cm). I have gray eyes, brown long hair, and I like to wear dark clothes. I'm usually really calm and everyone says my voice is really calming. But anyway, I like to paint, draw and play guitar. I listen to classical music while I paint because it helps me focus and gives me inspiration. I'm a pretty reserved person though.\n"
