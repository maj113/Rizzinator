miaIntr = "\n Hi I'm Mia and I'm 18 and a half. I've always been the tall girl and I was sometimes even bullied for it. I kind of get it I mean I'm 6ft4\" (195cm). I have gray eyes, brown long hair, and I like to wear dark clothes. I'm usually really calm and everyone says my voice is really calming. But anyway, I like to paint, draw and play guitar. I listen to classical music while I paint because it helps me focus and gives me inspiration. I'm a pretty reserved person though.\n"

MiaStory1 = 'you are walking down the hallway on your first day of college, when you look behind you and spot one of if not the most beautiful girl you have ever seen, walking behind you. You just can\'t take your eyes off of her and because you are walking with your head turned backwards, you bump into some poor guy who was just minding his buisness. Everything you are holding falls on the ground and you scramble to pick it all up. Suddenly a soft angelic voice asks you "hey, may I help you?" it\'s her! The beautifull tall motherly girl that caused you to drop all of your stuff. you become so flustered that you can\'t answer, watching as she picks your stuff up into a neat pile. "Here you go" she says with a smile on her stunning face. Before you have the chance to say anything she leaves just as the bell rings.\n'
MiaStory2 = "While in class, you are constantly thinking about the interaction you had with that beautiful girl in the hallway. You are so distracted by the taught of her, that you don't even notice the professor staring at you. After about five minutes of waiting the shouts \"{player}!!!\" but you don't notice him shouting, not even a bit. The professor comes up to you, and leans in very close to your face. \"wakey wakey!\" you snap out of your fantasies and become very flustered \"s- sorry Mr-\" too late the professor is already pointing toward the door signifying that you must leave the classroom. You leave your desk with great shame. You sit down on the bench right of the door and look around for a second. You see someone walking on the other side of the hall... w- wait is that her? It's that girl from before, the cause of your fantasies. In a moment of what seems to be pure insanity you decide \"fuck it! Imma ask her out!\" you stand up and head on over to her.\n\n"

miaAskOut1 = " H- hi, you're really beautiful, c- could I get your snap?\n"

miaAskOut2 = "H- hi... umm ugh... I- I umm... you get flustered so you decide to write your thoughts on your phones notepad* \"you look really beautiful\" :)\n"

miaReaction3 = "WHAT THE- go away creep"

MiaStory3 = "Mia added you on snap, and after sending your first snaps you immediately hit it off. You snapped for hours and agreed to meet up in the nearby park on Saturday. After you both said goodnight, your brain could only think about her. However, the amount of brainpower you dedicate to that little crush of yours has become concerning. It's taken a toll on your school performance. And you forgot to study for your math test. Not only that, but you also couldn't think of anything else other than her for the duration of the exam. It got so bad, that you wrote \"Mia\" as your name and class. The professor sent you to the principal's office to explain yourself. Thankfully the principal dismissed your stupidity as \"boys will be boys.\"  Saturday rolls around, and you nervously head to the town's small park. You spot god's favorite sitting on a park bench near a pond, bathed in rays of sunlight. She spots you and starts waving with a warm smile on her face. The closer you get to her, the redder your face gets. \"Heyyy ^-^\"\n"
